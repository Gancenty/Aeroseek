## ðŸ“Œ Abstract  
Though Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) hold immense potential for transforming the **Low-Altitude Economy**, developing an agent that combines both **intelligence and flexibility** remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a novel aerial navigation system, **AeroSeek**, designed to search executable paths that **coherently transition from cognitive understanding to physical movement**, enabling more **autonomous, flexible navigation** under instruction guidance.

Specifically, given a navigation instruction, we follow a **fast-slow thinking procedure** inspired by drone pilots, breaking down complex decisions into **manageable sub-tasks** and initiating motion planning **immediately** upon completion of each sub-task for real-time movement. By integrating **multi-Chain-of-Thought reasoning**, AeroSeek is capable of **spatial recognition and self-verification**, effectively searching for **robust sub-goals** under expected constraints.

For sub-goal navigation, we introduce **OnKi-RRT**, a novel **kinodynamic-aware motion planner** that ensures both **asymptotic optimality** and **dynamic obstacle avoidance**. Benefiting from the proposed **two-tier searching protocol**, AeroSeek demonstrates advanced capabilities in handling complex instructions while adapting to **dynamic aerial conditions**. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AeroSeek across **tasks of varying complexity**.
